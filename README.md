## Description

A simple command line tool to auto generate a header file containing an incrementing build number and the current build date and time.
It can be easily integrated into almost any IDE, which supports custom pre-build events (a command that gets called before compilation starts).
The generated header file can simply be added and included in any of your projects. It will be automatically updated every time you build your project.

See [instructions](#how-to-use-it) below for usage and how to include the tool in your Visual Studio project.


## Features

- Simple command line tool to integrate in your IDE's build process
- Build number counter
- Optional time and date of build
- Full Unicode support for paths / filenames
- Can be paused with BUILD_INFO_GENERATOR_PAUSE macro ([Show sample file](#sample-file))
- No need to build it yourself, compiled executable can be found [here](x64/Release/BuildInfoGenerator.exe)

## Download

You can download a prebuilt executable [here](x64/Release/BuildInfoGenerator.exe).

Needs the Visual Studio 2019 C++ runtime (vc_redist.x64.exe). Get it [from Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0).

## How to use it

### General

ToDo: General explanation

### Command line interface

~~~
Usage:
    BuildInfoGenerator [/h | /help] | ([/time] [/reset] /out "file")

Options:
    /h, /help        Display this help message.
    /time            Write build time and date to generated file.
    /reset           Reset the generated file and set the build number
                     back to zero.
    /out "file"      Specify the output file (relative or absolute).
~~~

Example to generate or update a file ("BuildInfo.h") with incrementing build number and build time and date.
If the file already exists, it's build number will be increased.
